-- Rollback: Remove default Perawat user
-- This migration removes the default admin user created by migration 21
-- NOTE: This will only run if you explicitly rollback migration 21
-- It will NOT run during normal migration up process
--
-- Rollback is disabled for safety - user data will not be deleted
-- If you need to remove the user, do it manually via Surrealist or API
